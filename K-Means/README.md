### Description
This project trains k-means model to recongnise digits in images. 
The code is in matlab. The script named 2digit.m trains the neural network to differentiate two digits i.e. classify an image of the digit into one of the two classes of digits. The script named 10digit.m trains the neural network to output the digit an image represents . The network is given all the ten classes of digit as input to learn a.

### Dataset
 This data was originally taken from the MNIST digit recognition database, but was converted into an easier to use le format. Each of the images in the dataset is represented by a set of 784 (2828) grayscale pixel values varying in the range [0,255]. The data was further processed 1 so that it could be easily used to experiment with K-means clustering. The processed dataset contains 1000 images for four dierent (1,3,5,7) handwritten digits. Each image is represented by a sequence of 157 grayscale pixel values (a subset of the original 784 pixel values).

### Usage
The scripts would work with matlab and octave. It can be run from matlab or octave

## Analysis
A small report is attached with tells about the behaviour of K-Means algorithm. Please find it in the repo. If you have any queries feel free to ask.
